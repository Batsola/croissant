    <h1>🥐Croissant</h1>
    <p>The history of the croissant is intriguing, as it has origins that can be traced back to Vienna, Austria. The croissant we know today is believed to have been influenced by the Austrian pastry known as "kipferl," a crescent-shaped roll. When Marie Antoinette, the Austrian-born queen of France, introduced kipferl to the French court, it laid the foundation for the development of the croissant as we now know it.</p>
